# Anomaly Detection applied to the Classification of Cytology Images

This paper includes the code to train the models for detecting anomalies in cytology images. 

- The anomalib folder contains the code to train the models using the [anomalib library](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib). 
- The reconstruction folder contains the code to train the models using a GAN model using the [FastAI library](https://www.fast.ai/).
